# foundry-messenger
Foundry Messenger is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop (FoundryVTT) that allows for seamless in-game communication between player characters (PCs) and non-player characters (NPCs). This tool provides a modern, futuristic messaging interface where players and the Game Master (GM) can send and receive messages between NPCs and players, adding depth to role-playing and immersion.

## Key Features:
### NPC Messaging:
The Game Master can assign NPCs to a messaging interface, enabling them to send messages to players as if they were chatting directly with their characters.
### Message History:
All messages sent through the messenger are saved and can be accessed at any time, ensuring a consistent and immersive experience across sessions.
### Easy Interface:
A clean, user-friendly interface for both the GM and players, with dedicated chat windows for each NPC.
### GM Control:
The GM can send messages to players as NPCs, allowing for complex interactions with the game world.
### Persistent History:
Messages are stored between sessions, ensuring that previous conversations remain available even after page reloads or game restarts.
